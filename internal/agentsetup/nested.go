// Context resolves the guide's destination by walking up from the working
// directory to the NEAREST .git, which is right until a repository is nested
// inside another. The documented build-from-source flow produces exactly that
// shape: `git clone entire-brain` inside a project, `cd entire-brain`, install
// — and leaves the shell inside the clone, so the next `init-agents` writes
// AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and the guide into the clone instead of the project.
// The clone is usually untracked by the outer repository, so the files are
// invisible to the team the guide was meant for and nothing reports an error.
//
// Returning the outer root lets the caller name both paths and let the person
// decide, rather than silently picking the inner one.

	// anything under a dotfiles-tracked home -- came back with that ancestor
	// and the caller announced "<root> is a git repository inside <outer>"
	// about a path that is not a repository at all. The remedy it suggests
	// then addresses nothing.
	//
	// Checking here rather than at the call site keeps the guarantee with the
	// function that makes the claim: OuterRepo returns an outer repository
	// only when there is genuinely an inner one.
